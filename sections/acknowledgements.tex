I, Andrés Gómez, wish to express my deepest gratitude to Amalia Betancur. Upon my arrival as a researcher at EIA University, she welcomed me warmly and significantly contributed to my understanding of quantum field theory. More than just a mentor in academia, she provided the encouragement and motivation that are often crucial when embarking on a challenging endeavor like this one. Her unwavering faith, coupled with a soothing calmness, has been the true catalyst that spurred the construction of this compendium. Above all, I want to thank her for that essential push, which we sometimes need to navigate through complex academic terrains.
